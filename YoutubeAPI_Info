Required parameters:
part:   string
        The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more search resource properties that the API response will include. Set the parameter value to snippet. 

Filters:
forContentOwner 	boolean
                    This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request, and it is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

                    The forContentOwner parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos owned by the content owner identified by the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter. If forContentOwner is set to true, the request must also meet these requirements:

                    The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter is required.
                    The user authorizing the request must be using an account linked to the specified content owner.
                    The type parameter value must be set to video.
                    None of the following other parameters can be set: videoDefinition, videoDimension, videoDuration, videoEmbeddable, videoLicense, videoPaidProductPlacement, videoSyndicated, videoType.

forDeveloper 	    boolean
                    This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. The forDeveloper parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos uploaded via the developer's application or website. The API server uses the request's authorization credentials to identify the developer. The forDeveloper parameter can be used in conjunction with optional search parameters like the q parameter.

                    For this feature, each uploaded video is automatically tagged with the project number that is associated with the developer's application in the Google Developers Console.

                    When a search request subsequently sets the forDeveloper parameter to true, the API server uses the request's authorization credentials to identify the developer. Therefore, a developer can restrict results to videos uploaded through the developer's own app or website but not to videos uploaded through other apps or sites.

forMine 	        boolean
                    This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. The forMine parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos owned by the authenticated user. If you set this parameter to true, then the type parameter's value must also be set to video. In addition, none of the following other parameters can be set in the same request: videoDefinition, videoDimension, videoDuration, videoEmbeddable, videoLicense, videoPaidProductPlacement, videoSyndicated, videoType.

Optional parameters:
channelId 	string
The channelId parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created by the channel.

Note: Search results are constrained to a maximum of 500 videos if your request specifies a value for the channelId parameter and sets the type parameter value to video, but it does not also set one of the forContentOwner, forDeveloper, or forMine filters.


location 	string
The location parameter, in conjunction with the locationRadius parameter, defines a circular geographic area and also restricts a search to videos that specify, in their metadata, a geographic location that falls within that area. The parameter value is a string that specifies latitude/longitude coordinates e.g. (37.42307,-122.08427).

    The location parameter value identifies the point at the center of the area.
    The locationRadius parameter specifies the maximum distance that the location associated with a video can be from that point for the video to still be included in the search results.

The API returns an error if your request specifies a value for the location parameter but does not also specify a value for the locationRadius parameter.

Note: If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.
locationRadius 	string
The locationRadius parameter, in conjunction with the location parameter, defines a circular geographic area.

The parameter value must be a floating point number followed by a measurement unit. Valid measurement units are m, km, ft, and mi. For example, valid parameter values include 1500m, 5km, 10000ft, and 0.75mi. The API does not support locationRadius parameter values larger than 1000 kilometers.

Note: See the definition of the location parameter for more information.

maxResults 	    unsigned integer
                The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. Acceptable values are 0 to 50, inclusive. The default value is 5.
                onBehalfOfContentOwner 	string
                This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.


order 	        string
                The order parameter specifies the method that will be used to order resources in the API response. The default value is relevance.

                Acceptable values are:

                    date – Resources are sorted in reverse chronological order based on the date they were created.
                    rating – Resources are sorted from highest to lowest rating.
                    relevance – Resources are sorted based on their relevance to the search query. This is the default value for this parameter.
                    title – Resources are sorted alphabetically by title.
                    videoCount – Channels are sorted in descending order of their number of uploaded videos.
                    viewCount – Resources are sorted from highest to lowest number of views. For live broadcasts, videos are sorted by number of concurrent viewers while the broadcasts are ongoing.

pageToken 	    string
                    The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.

publishedAfter 	datetime
                    The publishedAfter parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created at or after the specified time. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

publishedBefore 	datetime
                    The publishedBefore parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created before or at the specified time. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

q 	string
                    The q parameter specifies the query term to search for.

                    Your request can also use the Boolean NOT (-) and OR (|) operators to exclude videos or to find videos that are associated with one of several search terms. For example, to search for videos matching either "boating" or "sailing", set the q parameter value to boating|sailing. Similarly, to search for videos matching either "boating" or "sailing" but not "fishing", set the q parameter value to boating|sailing -fishing. Note that the pipe character must be URL-escaped when it is sent in your API request. The URL-escaped value for the pipe character is %7C.

regionCode 	string
                    The regionCode parameter instructs the API to return search results for videos that can be viewed in the specified country. The parameter value is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

relevanceLanguage 	string
                    The relevanceLanguage parameter instructs the API to return search results that are most relevant to the specified language. The parameter value is typically an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code. However, you should use the values zh-Hans for simplified Chinese and zh-Hant for traditional Chinese. Please note that results in other languages will still be returned if they are highly relevant to the search query term.

safeSearch 	string
                    The safeSearch parameter indicates whether the search results should include restricted content as well as standard content.

                    Acceptable values are:

                        moderate – YouTube will filter some content from search results and, at the least, will filter content that is restricted in your locale. Based on their content, search results could be removed from search results or demoted in search results. This is the default parameter value.
                        none – YouTube will not filter the search result set.
                        strict – YouTube will try to exclude all restricted content from the search result set. Based on their content, search results could be removed from search results or demoted in search results.

topicId 	string
                    The topicId parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources associated with the specified topic. The value identifies a Freebase topic ID.

                    Important: Due to the deprecation of Freebase and the Freebase API, the topicId parameter started working differently as of February 27, 2017. At that time, YouTube started supporting a small set of curated topic IDs, and you can only use that smaller set of IDs as values for this parameter.

                    See topic IDs supported as of February 15, 2017

type 	string
                    The type parameter restricts a search query to only retrieve a particular type of resource. The value is a comma-separated list of resource types. The default value is video,channel,playlist.

                    Acceptable values are:

                        channel
                        playlist
                        video

videoCategoryId 	string
                    The videoCategoryId parameter filters video search results based on their category. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.

videoDefinition 	string
                    The videoDefinition parameter lets you restrict a search to only include either high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) videos. HD videos are available for playback in at least 720p, though higher resolutions, like 1080p, might also be available. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.

                    Acceptable values are:

                        any – Return all videos, regardless of their resolution.
                        high – Only retrieve HD videos.
                        standard – Only retrieve videos in standard definition.

videoDimension 	string
                    The videoDimension parameter lets you restrict a search to only retrieve 2D or 3D videos. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.

                Acceptable values are:

                    2d – Restrict search results to exclude 3D videos.
                    3d – Restrict search results to only include 3D videos.
                    any – Include both 3D and non-3D videos in returned results. This is the default value.

videoDuration 	string
                The videoDuration parameter filters video search results based on their duration. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.

                Acceptable values are:

                    any – Do not filter video search results based on their duration. This is the default value.
                    long – Only include videos longer than 20 minutes.
                    medium – Only include videos that are between four and 20 minutes long (inclusive).
                    short – Only include videos that are less than four minutes long.


videoLicense 	string
                The videoLicense parameter filters search results to only include videos with a particular license. YouTube lets video uploaders choose to attach either the Creative Commons license or the standard YouTube license to each of their videos. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.

                Acceptable values are:

                    any – Return all videos, regardless of which license they have, that match the query parameters.
                    creativeCommon – Only return videos that have a Creative Commons license. Users can reuse videos with this license in other videos that they create. Learn more.
                    youtube – Only return videos that have the standard YouTube license.
